# Distributed Web Infrastructure Design

![Distributed Web Infrastructure](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KwQ7xKHB_Md7n_22OEgT2kRmEOG2hO-DqiIkIeE3vZM/edit?usp=sharing)

# Components

- **Load Balancer (HAProxy)**
  - **Purpose**: Distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers.
  - **Algorithm**: Round Robin - evenly distributes requests sequentially.

- **Web Server (Nginx)**
  - **Purpose**: Handles HTTP requests and serves static content.

- **Application Server**
  - **Purpose**: Runs the business logic of the application.

- **Database (MySQL)**
  - **Primary-Replica Cluster**: Ensures high availability and load distribution.
  - **Primary Node**: Handles all write operations and propagates changes.
  - **Replica Node**: Handles read operations.

# Issues with This Infrastructure

- **SPOF (Single Point of Failure)**
  - Load Balancer and Primary Database Node can be single points of failure.

- **Security Issues**
  - No Firewall: Vulnerable to unauthorized access.
  - No HTTPS: Data transmitted is not encrypted.

- **No Monitoring**
  - Lack of monitoring tools to track performance and detect issues.

# Enhancements

- Implement redundant load balancers.
- Set up automated failover for the database.
- Implement firewalls.
- Use HTTPS for secure communication.
- Deploy monitoring tools.
