# Secured and Monitored Web Infrastructure Design

![Secured and Monitored Web Infrastructure](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YNUKWMRweYxt5bVfcot4e-ePAI5oWbmh/view?usp=sharing)

## Components

- **Load Balancer (HAProxy)**
- **Web Servers (Nginx)**
- **Application Servers**
- **Database (MySQL)**

## Additional Elements for Security and Monitoring

- **3 Firewalls**: Protect different segments of the infrastructure.
- **SSL Certificate**: Ensures encrypted traffic over HTTPS for secure communication.
- **3 Monitoring Clients**: Collect data for performance and security monitoring.

## Explanation of Components

1. **Firewalls**:
   - **Purpose**: Protect different segments of the infrastructure by filtering traffic based on predefined security rules.
   - **Placement**: 
     - Perimeter: Protects the entire network.
     - Between Load Balancer and Web Servers.
     - Between Web Servers and Database Servers.

2. **HTTPS**:
   - **Purpose**: Ensures encrypted traffic between users and the server, protecting sensitive data from being intercepted.
   - **Importance**: Provides confidentiality, data integrity, and authentication.

3. **Monitoring**:
   - **Purpose**: Track system performance, detect anomalies, and ensure optimal operation.
   - **Data Collection**: Collect metrics and logs from servers for analysis and alerting.
   - **Monitoring Web Server QPS**: Configure the monitoring client to track HTTP requests processed by the web server using tools like Prometheus and Grafana.

## Infrastructure Issues

1. **Terminating SSL at the Load Balancer**:
   - **Issue**: Unencrypted traffic between the load balancer and internal servers.
   - **Solution**: Use end-to-end encryption.

2. **Single MySQL Server for Writes**:
   - **Issue**: Single point of failure for write operations.
   - **Solution**: Implement MySQL replication with automated failover.

3. **Homogeneous Servers**:
   - **Issue**: Resource contention and scaling issues.
   - **Solution**: Separate roles of servers for optimal performance and easier scaling.
